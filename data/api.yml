    description: ! "Aura constructor and main entry point\n\nEvery instance of Aura
      is an Aura application.\nAn Aura application is in charge of loading the various\nextensions
      that will apply to it (defined either\nprogrammatically or by iway of confifuration).\n\nAn
      Aura application is the glue between all the extensions\nand components inside
      its instance.\n\nInternally an Aura application wraps 4 important objects:\n\n-
      `config` is the object passed as the first param of the apps constructor\n-
      `core`   is a container where the extensions add new features\n- `sandbox` is
      an object that will be used as a prototype, to create fresh sandboxes to the
      components\n- `extensions` An instance of the ExtensionManager. It contains
      all the extensions that will be loaded in the app.\n    Extensions are here
      to provide features that will be used by the components...\n    They are meant
      to extend the apps' core & sandbox.\n    They also have access to the apps's
      config.\n\nExample of a creation of an Aura Application:\n\n    var app = aura(config);\n
      \   app.use('ext1').use('ext2');\n    app.registerComponentsSource('http://my.external/components/store',
      'supercomponents');\n    app.start();"

    A sandbox is a way to implement the facade pattern on top of the features provided
    by `core`.


    The `sandbox` property of an Aura application is just a blueprint that will be
    used

    as a prototype, once the app is started, to create new instances

    of sandboxed environments for the components.'

  description: ! "Tells the app to load the given extension.\n\n aura extensions are
    loaded in the app during init.\n they are responsible for :\n\n - resolving &
    loading external dependencies via requirejs\n - they have a direct access to the
    app's internals\n - they are here to add new features to the app... that are made
    available through the sandboxes to the components.\n\n\n\n Extensions can have
    multiple forms :\n\n* *Module name*\n\n````\naura().use('my/ext')\n````\n\n* *Function*\n\n````\nvar
    ext = function(app) {\n app.core.hello = function() {  alert(\"Hello World\")
    };\n}\naura().use(ext);\n````\n* *Object litteral*\n\n````\nvar ext = {\n require:
    {},\n initialize: function(app) {\n   app.core.hello = function() {  alert(\"Hello
    World\") };\n }\n}\naura().use(ext);\n````\n\n The Object litteral form allows
    :\n\n - to add dependencies\n - to add lifecycle callbacks (ex. `afterAppStart`)\n\n
    here is an example of a very simple backbone extension:\n\n````\ndefine(function()
    {\n var historyStarted = false;\n var ext = {\n   require: {\n     paths: {\n
    \      backbone:     'components/backbone/backbone'\n       underscore:   'components/underscore/underscore'\n
    \    },\n     shim: {\n       backbone: { exports: 'Backbone', deps: ['underscore']
    }\n     }\n   },\n   initialize: function(app) {\n     app.core.mvc = require('backbone');\n
    \    app.sandbox.View = function(view) { return app.core.mvc.View.extend(view);
    }\n   },\n   afterAppStart: function(app) {\n     if (historyStarted) return;\n
    \    Backbone.history.start();\n     historyStarted = true;\n   }\n }\n return
    ext;\n});\n````\n\n The extension provides the path mapping of its dependencies
    (backbone).\n When the extension is used in an app, the ExtManager configures\n
    requirejs with the right paths and requires all of them.\n\n Actually what it
    will do corresponds to (pseudo-code):\n\n     function requireExtension(ext) {\n
    \      require.config({ paths: { ... }, shim: { ... } })\n       require(['backbone',
    'underscore'], function(Backbone, _) {\n         $.when(ext.initialize(app)).then(
    ... load next extension ... );\n       })\n     }\n\n\n When all the extension's
    dependencies are required, the `init` method is called.\n `ext.init` may return
    a promise, ExtManager wait for `ext.init` resolution to load the next extension.\n\n
    When all the app's extensions are finally loaded, the extensions `ext.afterAppStart`
    methods are then called.\n\n ... then the app is considered ready !\n\n After
    `app.start` has been called, it is not possible to register new extensions.\n\n
    *Example of an extension with an initialize method that returns a promise*\n\n
    Let's wrap FB sdk as an aura extension :\n\n     var facebookExtension = {\n\n
    \      require: {\n         paths: {\n           facebook: 'http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js'\n
    \        }\n       },\n\n       initialize: function(app) {\n         var status
    = app.core.data.deferred();\n         app.sandbox.auth = {\n           login:
    FB.login,\n           logout: FB.logout\n         };\n\n         FB.init({ appId:
    'xxx' });\n\n         FB.getLoginStatus(function(res) {\n           app.sandbox.auth.loginStatus
    = res;\n           status.resolve(res);\n         }, true);\n\n         return
    status;\n       },\n\n       afterAppStart: function(app) {\n         console.warn(\"The
    app is started and I am : \", app.sandbox.auth.loginStatus);\n       }\n\n     }\n\n
    \    aura().use(facebookExtension).start().then(function() {\n       console.warn(\"My
    app is now started... and I am sure that getLoginStatus has been called and has
    returned somthing...\");\n     });\nThis method can only be called before the
    app is actually started.\nNote that the app is started when its `start` method
    is called."
