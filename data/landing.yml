    An Aura component represents a unit of a page. 
    An indepdenant block of reusable code, wrapped 
    up so that it works well on it's own or together with 
    other components. 

    Specify a component source and you can just start
    including them in your page on demand
    with data attributes
    (e.g <div data-aura-component="chat"></div>)

    A component can contain pretty much any code
    you want, using any framework and are a little like
    HTML Imports.

    Aura Extensions help you extend the core capabilities of your app 
    before any of your components load. Want to ensure all of them have 
    access to a particular library, like Backbone or API wrapper like GitHub? 

    It'll make them available via the component's sandbox so you don't have
    to worry about importing and setting this up yourself.

    An Aura sandbox is the layer between you and your library. 
    It lets you expose parts of a JavaScript library that are safe to
    use rather than the entire API.  It's particularly useful in teams, but also means
    you have the flexibility to switch our libraries with greater ease.

    Aura Events give components a rich way to communicate between each other
    by subscribing, unsubscribing and emitting sandboxed event notifications.
